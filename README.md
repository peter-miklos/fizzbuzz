# Fizzbuzz challenge - week 4

Fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge. The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:
- The program can be passed a number.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
- In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

Versions:
- Standard version (lib/fizzbuzz.rb): call the `fizzbuzz(n)` method, where you pass the number as n.
- Enhanced version (lib/fizzbuzz_new.rb): call the fizzbuzz method on the number(n): `n.fizzbuzz`

For testing RSpec is used: runnable spec files are available in spec folder.
